This project allows the Arduino to communicate with a Java application launched via the web using JNLP (aka JaWS, or Java Web Start).  
It uses the RxTx library. Thanks to the folks at rxtx.qbang.org for providing this library.

The output on the screen is rudimentary oscilloscope, which uses a BufferStrategy to update as rapidly as possible.

THIS CODE IS RELEASED, OF COURSE, WITHOUT ANY GUARANTEES.  PLEASE FEEL FREE TO REUSE WITH ATTRIBUTION, INCLUDING rxtx.qbang.org

The jars have been self-signed.  If you make modifications to the Java code, you can
re-sign your own jar with the following lines of code:

> javac -cp RXTXcomm.jar Arduscoplet.java                  # compile
> jar cvf Arduscoplet.jar Arduscoplet.class                # jar-ify
> jarsigner Arduscoplet.jar <somekey>                      # sign

You must rename the following file:
  www/arduscoplet_example.jnlp
   to
  www/arduscoplet.jnlp
and adjust the path to match the absolute URL where you will post this

Code in the Arduino directory will send samples read as analogue from pin 0
and send them at 115200 baud, with 7 bits of precision (signed)
